## 🌑 Manifesto
We are building the Linux for the human mind.

AxonOS is an open-source, neural operating system designed to bridge the gap between biological intelligence and artificial agents. In a world of proprietary data silos, AxonOS provides a sovereign execution environment for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).

We believe your neural data is the ultimate private property. Our architecture ensures you maintain "root access" to your own cognition.

## ⚡ Key Features

* 🧠 Real-Time Kernel: A modular core designed for sub-millisecond signal processing and low-latency feedback loops.
* 🛡️ Mind Sandbox: Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verified data streams. Your raw neural data never leaves the local enclave unless you explicitly sign the transaction.
* 🔌 Universal HAL: Hardware Abstraction Layer supporting major BCI headsets (OpenBCI, Muse, Neurosity, Custom Implants).
* 🤖 Agent Protocol: Native runtime for AI agents that react to cognitive states (Focus, Flow, Stress) in real-time.
